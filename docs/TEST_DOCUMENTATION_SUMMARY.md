**Implementation**:
- Test cache storage and retrieval
- Verify performance improvements from cache hits
- Test cache persistence across app sessions
- Validate cache invalidation scenarios

### 3. Large Dataset Handling
**Critical Requirement**: Ensure app scales with realistic data volumes

**Implementation**:
- Test with 1000+ LEGO sets
- Verify scrolling performance with large lists
- Test search functionality across large datasets
- Monitor memory usage during intensive operations

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
**Critical Requirement**: Graceful degradation when errors occur

**Implementation**:
- Test network error scenarios
- Test cache corruption recovery
- Verify UI error states are displayed appropriately
- Test retry functionality and error recovery

## Swift Testing Framework Usage

### Key Advantages
- Modern Swift-first syntax with `@Test` attributes
- Better concurrency support with async/await
- More expressive assertions with `#expect` and `#require`
- Improved error handling and debugging

### Migration from XCTest
Following Apple's guidance for migrating from XCTest:

```swift
// XCTest approach
import XCTest
class LegoSetTests: XCTestCase {
    func testDataLoading() {
        XCTAssertTrue(condition)
    }
}

// Swift Testing approach
import Testing
@Suite("LEGO Set Tests")
struct LegoSetTests {
    @Test("Data loading works correctly")
    func dataLoading() async throws {
        #expect(condition)
    }
}
```

## Test Execution Strategy
